# Welcome to the Org of WZS!
Hi! I'm 温照森. I'm going to graduate and join Thoughtworks in Feb 2022. Hope this profile can help you know me.

This is me in 2021.

My name is easy to remember. The meaning of my name is the warm light shining the forest.

I aim to be a front-end developer. It's pleasant to build useful web pages and applications. I'm familiar with Javascript but know little about Java. 

I'm an easygoing person and good at communication. I enjoy exploring new things. 

### Hobbies

running, ball games such as basketball and badminton, anime, music.
